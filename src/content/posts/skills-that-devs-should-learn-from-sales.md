# Mad Men
The first thing that pops in my head when I think about sales is the [Carousel Pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus) from [Mad Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/). The lead actor's goal is to sell an ad campaign for a photo projector. And he does a fine job. 

> Nostalgia - it's delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, "nostalgia" literally means "the pain from an old wound." It's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards... it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called the wheel, it's called the carousel. It let's us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.

Instead of selling the photo projector, Don Draper sold nostalgia!

# My background in sales
While still in college, selling hoodies was my side gig. My first company was a sales accelration tool (which ironically didn't sell itself).
I have worked in a boiler room, knocked on doors, given countless presentations and off-lately, have been learning inbound marketing, SEO and chatbots.

It's a fact that selling is not my strongest skill. Building scalable systems is. 

# Sales is an honest profession

# People buy emotions evoked by the product, not the product

# Guage demand before building

# Think like the end user

# Alternatives are better than Resistance

Deals take time

Always be closing
