Meta Blocks is a small project. This doesn't mean that we cannot pay competitively. But it does mean that we cannot afford to pay competitively to the wrong candidates. To achieve this, we have an hiring process that evaluates a potential team mate at the level of technical ability, communication skills and compatibility with the existing team.

## Step 1: You apply

We maintain a list of open positions on our [careers](/careers) page. If you think you fit for any role, you send in your application.

 Sometimes, we actively scout people on LinkedIn, Discord, Hacker News, Dribbble or other communities. In that case, we will ask you if you are interested in working with us. If yes, we'd request some information like your portfolio or resume.

## Step 2: Intro call

Depending on the role you applied for, a member of our team will schedule an intro call with you. The purpose of this call is to:

* Get to know you as a person
* Evaluate your compatibility with the team
* Understand your motivations for applying
* Understand your past experiences
* Answer any questions you might have about the company or the position

üí°The intro call is a good time for you to evaluate us too!

## Step 3: Coding/Design Challenge

For technical roles, we want to see your work. Depending on the role you have applied for, we will send you a small challenge. This could include designing a small piece, writing code or even creating a system design. 

We understand that you might be busy at the moment. So, there is no hard time-limit on finishing the challenge. Just keep us updated on your progress. In general, it should take about 2-4 hours to complete the challenge.

If the challenge is significant, we  compensate you for attempting it. Even if we don't end up hiring you.

If you have a strong public profile, open source contributions or references, we might skip the challenge step completely.

## Step 4: Intro to the team/ technical talk

If you finish the challenge, we will ask you to meet some other members of the team. This call delve deeper into your experiences. Here, we might ask you some technical questions, related to your challenge submission or your past experience. 

This is a good opportunity for you to meet people you will work with. It's a two way street: you need to like us, and we need to like you ü§ù.

## Step 5: Decision within 72 hours

After the final call. We will give you our decision within 72 hours.
