Welcome to the Meta Blocks handbook. Inspired by [Sourcegraph's Handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com), this handbook helps with, and documents  all operations at Meta Blocks.

The handbook is useful for current Meta Blocks team to look up and execute processes. It's also an effort to become a transparent organisation. Our hypothesis is that by making our processes open, we will attract people that share similar values.
