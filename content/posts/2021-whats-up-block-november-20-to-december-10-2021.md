Welcome back to “What’s up, block?”, our update aggregation for partners and friends. 

The last two weeks have been hectic, but the progress has been good. Meta Blocks has grown to a community of 1000 strong across channels. Thank you all for your support 🙏 this is just the beginning. 

**Good:**

* We've set up our legal entities and figured out our invoicing and liquidity issues, thanks to the law firms we spoke to in Singapore. 💼
* We recieved our first tranch of liquidity from one of our investors 💵, so we're going in full build mode.
* We've stopped actively seeking investors and strategic partners for our seed round, but there's still space for some "big dogs" that have shown their interest. 
* Sarthak has shortlisted a handful of promising 3D artists and we'll close soon. 👩🏼‍🎨 - 
* We've partnered with a digital fashion brand 👗 who'll release their clothing as drops for Meta Blocks avatar. 
* Shivek published an article 📝 - The Metaverse Belongs to You ([](https://metablocks.world/blog/clay-bricks-vs-legos)https://metablocks.world/blog/the-metaverse-belongs-to-you). TL;DR: The big corpos like Facebook and Microsoft won't give you the ownership of your items in their Metaverse and will lock you withthin their ecosytsem. We need to fight that, together! 💪
* We're hosted our first Twitter Space. 
* We released Meta Knights, a community reward NFT. 
* Tweet to amplify:

* **Not Good:**
* Our most immediate hurdle is to ship the protocol on time (before the end of 2021), so other projects can start building upgradeable NFTs. 

If you're a project who'd like to use our protocol or a make drops for our avatars (like clothing), please reach out to please reach me via email or Discord. 

🔮☮️🤙
