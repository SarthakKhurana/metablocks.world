Welcome to the first issue of “What’s up, block?”, our update aggregation for partners and friends. We are testing out a public update to start with. In future, we might make this private.

It has been a lovely last week for the Meta Blocks protocol.

**Good:**

* A fund closely connected to MonkeDAO 🦍and other famous NFT projects agreed to join the cap table 💫 (verbal commitment 🙊). Their support will make it easy to onboard existing projects as partners in the Meta Blocks universe
* In terms of seed round, there is enough interest to close right now, but we think it’s important to bring a few more strategic partners 🤝
* Sarthak is working in full swing to hire a senior 3d artist 👩🏼‍🎨 - about 10 interviews scheduled for the next week
* We already had partners to help with Smart Contract and Android app development. We have asked them to start the initial research and a proof-of-concept (We are paying them out of pocket 💸)
* Figured out a way to manage combinatoric explosion of our avatars using the awesome work done by an open-source project called comicgen (<https://gramener.com/comicgen/>) - Our 🤖 avatars will be built on top of their foundations 
* We published two articles 📝 - one about protocol (<https://metablocks.world/blog/clay-bricks-vs-legos>) and other about our insights (<https://metablocks.world/blog/lets-start-with-blocks>)  : retweets are much appreciated
* Tweet to amplify: https://twitter.com/MetaBlocksHQ/status/1463580843012624388
* We are hosting a 🐦Twitter Space with @solNFTradar on “The Metaverse belongs to YOU”.  Please join us and bring your friends 🤗. Sarthak will reach out with details.

**Not Good:**

* India is going to ban crypto (yet again 😅) but this time it’s a bill not a draft. This means that crypto businesses will face hurdles, so we decided against an Indian entity
* We are in talks with a law firm 💼 in Singapore, a law firm in Mumbai and two online services that help setting up a crypto friendly entity. Figuring out liquidity and invoicing issues. Hope this will be done soon.

Our most immediate hurdle is to get a legal entity and receive funds. The hiring aspect is under control! We’ll be publishing a roadmap soon.

If you have any questions, please reach me on email, telegram or discord.
