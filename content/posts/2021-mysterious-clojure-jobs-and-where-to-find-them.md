I've been writing Clojure professionally for 5 years now, but still have a hard time recommending Clojure to friends and clients. My friend Anand, co-founder of [Koj](https://koj.co) aptly [said](https://youtu.be/O-bVJoWULBE?t=2228) that:

> JavaScript for me, is a language for making prototypes, and not a system that you want running after a decade from now.

Although I'm a Clojure fan-boy and advocate, the realist in me knows that Anand is right. Clojure has an adoption problem.

## What is Clojure?

Clojure is a functional LISP that with a futuristic feedback loop. It's hosted, has a strong following, and often reaches the first page of Hacker News. I'll not go into the details of the language as [many](https://simongray.github.io/essays/spread.html) [articles](https://medium.com/swlh/what-i-learned-after-writing-clojure-for-424-days-straight-8884ec471f8e) [already](https://itrevolution.com/love-letter-to-clojure-part-1/) [exist](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html) about this topic. Clojure's simplicity and expressiveness is a recurring theme in most descriptions of the language.

But this article is not about Clojure's beauty. It's about the challenges (and possible solutions) that stand in the way of mass adoption. It's not about being a successful artist, it's about being successful at the art bazaar.

## What is the adoption problem?

Despite the widespread praise about the Clojure language, we cannot refute the fact that it's hard to find Clojure developers. On the other hand, it's also hard to find a Clojure job. 

The problem turns into a chicken and egg paradox. There won't be enough developers, until there are enough jobs, and there won't be enough jobs, until there is a big talent pool.

A small talent pool leads to a small open-source footprint, and prevents network effects. If few developers write Clojure, fewer new developers will be introduced to the language, amplifying the chicken and egg problem.

## When should you not adopt Clojure?

Any mainstream language in the market is good enough. 

## What is a good use case for Clojure?

5 teams, spread across timezones, serving 10m clients is not just a technical problem. It's also a database problem, it's a design problem, it's a political problem. You not only need to maintain a system, you also need to manage expectations, react to competition and experiment with new ideas.

## What do we gain by solving adoption?

Race car driver vs Sedan driver

Excellent vs good enough

personal accounts of people and companies who did it

stable systems

software fatigue

## How do we solve adoption?

Upfront investment

Clojure is easy, after you have put the time upfront

Collecting resources

Marketing
