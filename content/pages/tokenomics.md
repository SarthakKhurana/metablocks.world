# Meta Blocks Tokenomics Draft

This document is a work in progress.

## Meta Blocks platform
The Meta Blocks platform consists of three major entities:
### 1. Meta Blocks App
A marketplace to trade Meta Blocks. Mobile and chrome applications to use stickers and generative capabilities of the platform 
### 2. Meta Blocks Art
An offcial artist account that creates universes of upgradable NFTs and consults other NFT projects to help with integrations
### 3. Meta Blocks Protocol
An open-source protcol to manage the combination of NFTs.

Together, the three entities constitute the Meta Blocks platform.  The tokenomics model is designed to yield the control of the platform to the community over a span of 8 years. We see ourselves as the maintainers of a community owned service.

## Participants
There are six major participants in the Meta Blocks eco-system operation:

### 1. Foundation
Creates and maintains Open Source Protcol and the closed source apps required for operation of the platform. Pays for web2 services, maintains a talent pool of full-time employees to manager the product, development, security and community operations. Maintains a legal entity and a multisig wallet. Creates documentation for other protocols and NFT projects to integrate the Meta Blocks Protocol.

### 2. Artists
Create compatible artwork that can be combined with existing Meta Blocks. Create multiple base-layer universes and compatible drops for existing or new universes on the Meta Blocks platform. Work in coordination with other NFT projects to implement the Meta Blocks standard and make their NFTs upgradeable. The Meta Blocks foundation also acts as an artist. 

### 3. Users
End consumers who buy, sell and use Meta Blocks as stickers, game characters and generative audio and visuals. A user can be a human user or a development team that integrate into the systems using our SDKs or on-chain programs.

### 4. Investors
Community leaders who provide with strategic inputs, industry connections and funding in exchange for a share of token supply. This share represents the Meta Blocks prtocol, the Meta Blocks app and the revenues generated from the Meta Blocks official art account.

### 5. Advisors
Similar to investors, except the inputs to the platform are exclusively non-monetory. Responsible for providing high-level overview and industry alignment insights.

### 6. Partners
Partners includes special entities or individuals that provide with operational know-how in the form of direct help with marketing, artwork and product development. A partner relation could be a trade, a charity or a barter.

## Economic loops and value capture 
The goal of Meta Blocks is to act as a universal identity layer. The platform allows you to carry your identity across universes with next to no effort. This is useful for a variety of participants. 

We are in the business of capturing the part of the brain related to self-expression. Meta Blocks aims to be the defacto way to express oneself across the Meta Verses. This expression demands a supply of characters, traits and attributes which is fulfilled by artists, hence creating an economic loop.

There are two major subsets of the economic loops:
### 1. Artist loop
The artist loop signifies the marketplace aspect of the system. An artist publishes a base-layer (abundant/not scarce). Then drops limited edition collectibles to enhance the utility of the base layer. These drops are a paid and can be bought and sold either on our platform, or externally. 

Regardless of where the trade occured, Meta Blocks platform charges a 5% platform fee that is distributed among various stake holders (specified later in this document). 

The drops that are sold on third-party platforms externally need to be combined in the Meta Blocks program with other Meta Blocks that you own. It's in this combination stage that we charge the 5% platform fee. For drops that were sold on our platform, this combination process is implicit.

The artists get to keep 95% of the sales amount. The artist can also add an addtional royalty on for subsequent sales. 

### 2. Stakeholder loop
In order to create the platform, the investors supply with initial capital and know-how. This entails risk and the investors need to be remunerated in proportion of the risks they endure. Other stake holders like the advisors or marketing partners also partake in this risky endeveour and need to be remunerated accordingly. 

Each stakeholder is remunerated in Meta Blocks tokens. This tokens unlock on a schedule. The stakeholder can sell these tokens on secondary markets, or stake them in the Meta Blocks program to avail a share of the platoform fee collected on sales of the drops. Staking provides benefits in the form of dividends, appreciation and buy-backs. More on this in the Token Supply section.

## Meta Blocks token supply ($MBK / áµ¯)
The total supply of the Meta Blocks token is limited to  $MBK 4,444,444 (4.44 million). The tokens will be pre-mined and locked in a contract. The tokens will unlock on a 4 to 8 year schedule and will be distributed to various stake holders as follows:
- 16% to Foundation multi-sig for managing the product and protocol - 4 year vest
- 8% to contributors/developers of the protcol - 4 year vest
- 16% to Investors - 4 year vest
- 10% to Advisors - 4 year vest
- 50% to as treasury for incentives to use the protocol and for token appreciation - Released over 8 year

### Token Distribution
The tokens represent the value being generated on the platform. This value can be direct, ie an artist mints a universe of Meta Blocks and users buy and use them. Or it could be indirect, eg: an early investor takes on the risk in building the protocol and contributes building the platform that generates the value. Another indirect value generation aspect is in the form of evangelism and support that can come in the form of sales.

To honor individidual actors that contribute in the generation of value on the Meta Blocks platform, the tokens from treasury will be distrbuted to artists and existing token holders.
